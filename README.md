Someone most likely a student will use this application to help them retain information and learn during lectures. The student will simply start recording the class from their mobile device. When the class is finished the student will stop the recording and our app will begin its processing phase. After processing the student will have an organized document with the full lecture summary.

This is important because it will allow students the flexibility to review what happened in any given lecture. As an additional benefit if a student loses focus they can rest assured that they did not miss anything. Our application will be necessary for students that wish to get the most out of lectures and want the security of not missing important details.
